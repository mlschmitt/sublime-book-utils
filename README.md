# Sublime Text Book Utility Packages

Helper Sublime Text packages for editing books, predominantly in markdown.  Likely only useful for me ingesting badly formatted books into Serial Reader.

* Add Line Breaks - Insert additional line break in selected text.
* Add Underscores - Wrap every selected line with underscores and trim whitespace.
* Select Words - Select all words from the top of the document to the next divider/chapter
* Wrap Lines - Remove line breaks from selected text
